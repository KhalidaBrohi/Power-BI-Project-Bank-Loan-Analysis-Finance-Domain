The Bank Loan Data Dashboard project highlights my expertise in SQL and Power BI by providing a comprehensive analysis of a bank's loan portfolio. It includes data extraction and transformation, relational data modeling, and the development of complex SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators. The interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes loan performance, customer demographics, and risk analysis, allowing users to explore the data dynamically. This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, create insightful analyses, and deliver impactful visualizations, making it a strong addition to my professional portfolio.
