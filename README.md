Bank Loan Data Dashboard
Project Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in SQL and Power BI by creating a comprehensive Bank Loan Data Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to provide insights into a bank's loan portfolio, including loan performance, customer demographics, and risk analysis. The project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, write complex SQL queries, and create dynamic visualizations in Power BI.

Project Goals
Data Extraction & Transformation: Extract loan data from multiple sources, clean and transform it using SQL to make it suitable for analysis.
Data Modeling: Design and implement a relational data model to efficiently store and retrieve loan data.
Analysis & Reporting: Develop SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan default rates, total loan amounts, customer segmentation, and risk factors.
Dashboard Creation: Use Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the insights from the loan data, allowing users to explore various aspects of the bank's loan portfolio.
Features
Loan Performance Analysis: Track the performance of loans over time, identifying trends in repayment, default, and loan disbursement.
Customer Demographics: Analyze the demographics of loan customers, including age, income, location, and loan type preferences.
Risk Analysis: Evaluate the risk associated with different loan products and customer segments, providing insights into areas that may require attention.
Interactive Filters: Enable users to filter the data by various dimensions such as loan type, customer age group, and geographic location.
Dynamic Visualizations: Present data through a series of interactive charts, graphs, and tables that update in real-time based on user selections.
Technologies Used
SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and modeling. Complex queries are written to calculate KPIs and aggregate data.
Power BI: Utilized to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that visualizes the bank loan data.
Microsoft SQL Server: The database system used to store and manage the loan data.
Excel: Initial data exploration and transformation steps are performed in Excel.
Data Sources
Bank Loan Data: A fictional dataset representing loan details, customer information, repayment history, and more.
External Data Sources: Additional datasets such as economic indicators or demographic data to enhance the analysis.
How to Use This Project
SQL Queries: Explore the SQL scripts provided in the /sql folder to understand how the data is extracted, cleaned, and transformed.
Power BI Dashboard: Download the Power BI report file from the /dashboard folder to interact with the Bank Loan Data Dashboard. Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.
Data Files: Sample datasets are available in the /data folder for testing and exploration.
Future Enhancements
Predictive Modeling: Implement machine learning models to predict loan defaults and customer behavior.
Real-time Data Integration: Integrate real-time data sources to provide up-to-date insights into the loan portfolio.
Advanced Visualizations: Explore the use of advanced visualizations and Power BI features to enhance the user experience.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates my expertise in SQL and Power BI, providing a full-stack solution for analyzing and visualizing bank loan data. It's a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my ability to work with data, create insightful analyses, and present them effectively.
